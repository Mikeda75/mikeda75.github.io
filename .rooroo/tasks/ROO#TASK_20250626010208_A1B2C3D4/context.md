User Request:
The excel sheet input file is actually an exported file from a google sheets docs.
At the company a new google sheets documents is generated from the template for each project.
What would be an efficient way to manage the generation of the project documents and also allow this program to access any given project.
I would like to maintain the online nature of the google sheets storage and I would like to keep the document as a google sheets document.
