## Task Context: Generate 2D Top-Down Casting Layout View

The user wants to implement a new feature that generates a 2D top-down view of physical casting layouts.

**Key Requirements:**
*   For each casting, display forms as simple rectangles.
*   Forms should be overlaid on a larger rectangle (representing the casting panel).
*   The output should be printable, similar to how stickers are currently handled.

**Relevant File:**
*   [`paneloptimizerfinal.html`](paneloptimizerfinal.html) - This file likely contains existing UI/logic for sticker generation and may serve as a reference or base for the new feature.

**Goal for Planner:**
Develop a plan to implement this 2D top-down view feature, considering the graphical generation, layout, and printability aspects. The plan should outline the necessary steps and suggest the appropriate Rooroo expert(s) for each step.
