**Parent Task ID:** ROO#TASK_20250625232340_A1B2C3D4
**Main Plan Overview:** [Main Plan Overview](../../plans/ROO#TASK_20250625232340_A1B2C3D4_plan_overview.md)

**Goal for Expert:** Implement user interaction and data management features for the casting layout visualization. This includes:
1.  Developing UI elements (e.g., input fields) for users to define casting panel and form dimensions.
2.  Implementing interactive features for placing, moving, and rotating forms on the panel using mouse/touch events.
3.  Adding functionality to save the current layout configuration (e.g., to local storage or a file).
4.  Adding functionality to load previously saved layout configurations.
5.  **CRITICAL:** Ensure all dimensions and positions are handled with dimensional accuracy, referencing a "casting schedule" (data source to be defined by the expert or user).
6.  **CRITICAL:** The feature should be integrated into the existing navigation flow, appearing after the "tracking figures" section.
