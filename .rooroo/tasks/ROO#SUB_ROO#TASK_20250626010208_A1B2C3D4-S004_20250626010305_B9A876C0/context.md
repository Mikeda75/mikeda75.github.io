# Sub-task Context: Document Management and Tracking Strategy

## Goal for Expert
Devise a robust strategy for organizing the generated Google Sheets documents within Google Drive and maintaining a centralized record or index of all generated project documents. This strategy should consider:
1.  **Organization within Google Drive:** How to structure folders (e.g., by project ID, client, year, or a combination) to ensure easy discoverability.
2.  **Tracking Mechanism:** How to maintain a record of all generated sheets. Options include:
    *   A master Google Sheet acting as an index (Project Name, Sheet ID, Folder ID, Creation Date, etc.).
    *   A simple local database (e.g., SQLite) or JSON file if the program is self-contained.
    *   Integration with an existing project management system if applicable (though this is out of scope for initial implementation).
3.  **Access Control Considerations:** Brief notes on how permissions might be managed for these documents.

## Parent Task Context
[Main Plan Overview](../../plans/ROO#TASK_20250626010208_A1B2C3D4_plan_overview.md)

The overall goal is to devise an efficient strategy for managing Google Sheets project document generation from a template and enabling program access to any given project, while maintaining online Google Sheets storage. This sub-task is crucial for long-term maintainability and usability of the generated documents.

## Deliverables
*   A detailed document outlining the proposed Google Drive organization structure.
*   A proposal for the tracking mechanism, including schema/structure if applicable (e.g., columns for a master Google Sheet).
*   Recommendations for implementing the chosen strategy within the programmatic solution.
