## Parent Task: Update Casting Layout Feature
[Main Plan Overview](../../plans/ROO#TASK_20250625233955_E6F7G8H9_plan_overview.md)

## Goal for Expert:
Modify the `paneloptimizerfinal.html` file to implement the casting layout feature with the following requirements:

1.  **Casting Area Selection:** Add a dropdown menu to allow the user to select between two casting areas: "Preset A" or "Preset B".
2.  **Casting Area A Details:**
    *   Consists of two adjacent tables.
    *   Table 1 dimensions: 65' x 5'
    *   Table 2 dimensions: 45' x 5'
3.  **Casting Area B Details:**
    *   Consists of one table.
    *   Table 1 dimensions: 5' x 10'
4.  **Automatic Form Fitting:** Implement JavaScript logic to automatically fit forms within the selected casting area based on the chosen preset. This will likely involve updating existing layout calculation functions or creating new ones.
