# Sub-task Context: Implement Google Sheets Access and Data Manipulation

## Goal for Expert
Develop functions within the script to read data from and write data to specific Google Sheets documents. This will involve:
1.  Authenticating with the Google Sheets API using the service account credentials.
2.  Identifying a target sheet by its ID or name.
3.  Reading data from specified ranges (e.g., `Sheet1!A1:B10`).
4.  Writing data to specified ranges.
5.  Handling common data types and potential errors during API interactions.

## Parent Task Context
[Main Plan Overview](../../plans/ROO#TASK_20250626010208_A1B2C3D4_plan_overview.md)

The overall goal is to devise an efficient strategy for managing Google Sheets project document generation from a template and enabling program access to any given project, while maintaining online Google Sheets storage. This sub-task focuses on the core data interaction capabilities with the generated project documents.

## Deliverables
*   A working script or code module with functions for reading and writing data to Google Sheets.
*   Examples of how to use these functions, including authentication and specifying sheet/range.
