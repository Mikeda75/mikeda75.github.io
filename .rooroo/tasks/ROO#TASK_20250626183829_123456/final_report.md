# Google Drive Integration Final Report

## Summary

This report details the implementation of a secure solution for accessing Google Drive files within the web application. The chosen method is **OAuth 2.0 with user sign-in**, which is the industry standard for securely accessing user data. This approach ensures that the application can support both current read-only requirements and future read/write capabilities in a secure and scalable manner.

## Key Features

*   **Secure User Authentication:** Users sign in with their own Google accounts, granting the application permission to access their files. This is handled through Google's secure OAuth 2.0 flow.
*   **Client-Side Implementation:** The entire authentication and file access process is handled on the client-side, simplifying the application architecture.
*   **Future-Ready:** The implemented solution is designed to be easily extended to support file writing and modification by adjusting the requested scopes.

## Setup Instructions

To enable the Google Drive integration, you must create an **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** in the Google Cloud Console and add it to the `index.html` file. Follow these steps carefully:

1.  **Go to Google Cloud Console:**
    *   Navigate to [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account.

2.  **Create a New Project:**
    *   If you don't have a project already, create a new one.

3.  **Enable the Google Drive API:**
    *   In the sidebar, navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**.
    *   Search for "Google Drive API" and click **Enable**.

4.  **Configure the OAuth Consent Screen:**
    *   In the sidebar, go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
    *   Choose **External** for the user type and click **Create**.
    *   Fill in the required information (app name, user support email, developer contact).
    *   You can leave the scopes and test users sections blank for now.

5.  **Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID:**
    *   In the sidebar, go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
    *   Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** and select **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**.
    *   For the **Application type**, select **Web application**.
    *   Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, add the URL where you are hosting the application (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).

6.  **Get the Client ID:**
    *   After creating the credential, Google will provide you with a **Client ID**. Copy this value.

7.  **Update `index.html`:**
    *   Open the `index.html` file and find the following line:
        ```javascript
        const CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE';
        ```
    *   Replace `'YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE'` with the Client ID you copied from the Google Cloud Console.

Once you have completed these steps, the "Sign in with Google" button will be fully functional, and users will be able to securely access their Google Drive files through the application.
