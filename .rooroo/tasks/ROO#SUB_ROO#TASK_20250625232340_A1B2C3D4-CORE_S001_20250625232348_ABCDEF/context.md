**Parent Task ID:** ROO#TASK_20250625232340_A1B2C3D4
**Main Plan Overview:** [Main Plan Overview](../../plans/ROO#TASK_20250625232340_A1B2C3D4_plan_overview.md)

**Goal for Expert:** Implement the interactive 2D top-down view of physical casting layouts. This includes:
1.  Setting up an HTML canvas or SVG element for drawing.
2.  Drawing a larger "casting panel" as a base rectangle.
3.  Enabling the drawing and display of "forms" as smaller rectangles overlaid on the casting panel.
4.  Ensuring basic visual representation and responsiveness.
5.  **CRITICAL:** The layout must be dimensionally accurate according to the casting schedule.
6.  **CRITICAL:** The feature should be integrated into the existing navigation flow, appearing after the "tracking figures" section.
