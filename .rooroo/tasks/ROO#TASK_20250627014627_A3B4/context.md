# Task Context for Sticker Sheet Content View Fix

**User Request:**
"The Sticker sheet content view does dont currently show the sticker sheet print layout. It only Shows the sticker sheet setting. Please ensure the elements are correctly displaye. Read Technical documentation"

**Refined Goal for Rooroo Developer:**
Modify the `index.html` file to ensure that when the 'Generate Stickers' button is clicked, the sticker sheet print layout is immediately displayed. This involves updating the event listener for the 'generate-stickers-button' to directly call the `generateStickers()` function, removing the conditional logic that opens the sticker settings by default. The `generateStickers()` function already handles displaying the sticker sheet container and closing the settings.

**Relevant Files for Developer's Consideration:**

- [GoogleAppsScriptGuide.md](GoogleAppsScriptGuide.md)
