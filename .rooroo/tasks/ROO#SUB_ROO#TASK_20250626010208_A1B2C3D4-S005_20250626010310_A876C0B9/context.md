# Sub-task Context: Integrate and Test the Solution

## Goal for Expert
Integrate all developed components (Google Cloud API setup, Google Sheets template duplication, Google Sheets data access and manipulation, and the document management strategy) into a cohesive, runnable solution. Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing to ensure all functionalities work as expected. This includes:
1.  Setting up the development environment with necessary libraries/SDKs.
2.  Configuring the service account credentials.
3.  Creating a main script or application flow that orchestrates the sub-tasks.
4.  Executing test cases for:
    *   Successful duplication of a template.
    *   Correct renaming and placement of the new sheet.
    *   Accurate reading of data from a generated sheet.
    *   Successful writing of data to a generated sheet.
    *   Proper tracking of the generated sheet in the chosen management system.
5.  Documenting any setup or runtime instructions.

## Parent Task Context
[Main Plan Overview](../../plans/ROO#TASK_20250626010208_A1B2C3D4_plan_overview.md)

The overall goal is to devise an efficient strategy for managing Google Sheets project document generation from a template and enabling program access to any given project, while maintaining online Google Sheets storage. This sub-task is the final step to ensure the entire solution is functional and robust.

## Deliverables
*   A fully integrated and tested programmatic solution.
*   A clear README or documentation file detailing how to set up, configure, and run the solution.
*   Confirmation of successful end-to-end testing.
