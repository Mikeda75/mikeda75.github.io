# Plan Overview: Google Sheets Project Document Management

## Overall Strategy
This plan outlines a strategy for efficiently managing Google Sheets project document generation from a template and enabling programmatic access. The approach involves leveraging Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Google APIs (Sheets and Drive) to automate document creation, organization, and data interaction, while maintaining online Google Sheets storage.

## Sub-tasks List

1.  **Google Cloud Project Setup & API Enablement**
    *   **Objective:** Set up a Google Cloud Project, enable necessary APIs (Google Sheets API, Google Drive API), and generate service account credentials for secure programmatic access.
    *   **Assigned Expert:** Rooroo Developer

2.  **Implement Google Sheets Template Duplication**
    *   **Objective:** Develop a script (e.g., in Python or Node.js) that can programmatically duplicate a specified Google Sheets template, rename the new sheet based on project details, and move it to a designated Google Drive folder.
    *   **Assigned Expert:** Rooroo Developer

3.  **Implement Google Sheets Access and Data Manipulation**
    *   **Objective:** Develop functions within the script to read data from and write data to specific Google Sheets documents. This will involve identifying sheets by ID or name and interacting with their cells/ranges.
    *   **Assigned Expert:** Rooroo Developer

4.  **Document Management and Tracking Strategy**
    *   **Objective:** Devise a robust strategy for organizing the generated Google Sheets documents within Google Drive (e.g., by project ID, client, or year) and maintaining a centralized record or index of all generated project documents (e.g., in a master Google Sheet or a simple database).
    *   **Assigned Expert:** Rooroo Architect

5.  **Integrate and Test the Solution**
    *   **Objective:** Integrate all developed components (API setup, template duplication, data access, and management strategy) into a cohesive, runnable solution. Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
    *   **Assigned Expert:** Rooroo Developer

## Key Dependencies
*   Sub-task 1 (Google Cloud Setup) is a prerequisite for all other development sub-tasks.
*   Sub-tasks 2 and 3 can be developed in parallel to some extent but will need to be integrated.
*   Sub-task 4 (Management Strategy) will inform the implementation details of Sub-tasks 2 and 3 regarding file organization.

## Assumptions Made
*   The user has a Google account with sufficient permissions to create GCP projects and manage Google Drive files.
*   The "program" mentioned in the goal will be a script or application that can execute code (e.g., Python, Node.js).
*   The Google Sheets template is stable and its structure will not frequently change.
