# Plan Overview: Refactor CWE Production Dashboard Navigation

## Overall Strategy
This plan aims to refactor the navigation system of the CWE Production Dashboard to align with the "Stateful Wizard" model described in `NavigationDesign.md`. The current navigation logic, which relies on showing/hiding elements via direct DOM manipulation in various event listeners, will be centralized into a dedicated JavaScript module. This will improve maintainability, readability, and extensibility. The refactoring will ensure all view transitions and button visibility adhere strictly to the design document.

## Sub-tasks List

1.  **Analyze Current Navigation & Detail Code Changes**
    *   **Objective:** Analyze the existing `index.html` and `Code.gs` files to understand the current navigation implementation. Identify specific HTML elements that need modification or creation, and outline the JavaScript functions and logic required to manage view visibility and transitions according to `NavigationDesign.md`. The output will be a detailed list of required code changes, including a proposed structure for a centralized navigation module.

2.  **Implement Navigation Refactoring**
    *   **Objective:** Implement the identified HTML and JavaScript changes to refactor navigation elements and general program navigation. This includes creating the centralized navigation module and updating all relevant event listeners to utilize this new module for managing view states and transitions, ensuring full alignment with `NavigationDesign.md`.

3.  **Update Documentation**
    *   **Objective:** Update relevant project documentation (e.g., `README.md`, `Dev Documentation`) to reflect the new navigation structure, the centralized navigation module, and any significant changes in the user flow or technical implementation.
    *   **Assigned Expert:** `rooroo-documenter`

## Key Dependencies
*   Sub-task 2 (`Implement Navigation Refactoring`) is dependent on the detailed analysis and proposed changes from Sub-task 1 (`Analyze Current Navigation & Detail Code Changes`).
*   Sub-task 3 (`Update Documentation`) is dependent on the completion of Sub-task 2 (`Implement Navigation Refactoring`) to accurately document the implemented changes.

## Assumptions Made
*   The core functionality of data parsing and output generation (e.g., `generateSchedule`, `generateStickers`, `generateTrackingSheet`, `drawCastingLayout`) will remain largely unchanged, with only their display triggers being updated by the new navigation logic.
*   The existing CSS styles are sufficient for the visual presentation of the refactored navigation elements, and no major CSS overhauls are required as part of this task.

## Potential Risks
*   Introducing regressions in existing navigation flows if the refactoring is not thoroughly tested.
*   Complexity in disentangling existing intertwined UI logic from navigation logic.
