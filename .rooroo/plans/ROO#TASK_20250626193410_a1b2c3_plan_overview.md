# Plan Overview for ROO#TASK_20250626193410_a1b2c3: Implement HTML Dropdown with Apps Script Integration

## Overall Strategy
This plan addresses the goal of adding a menu dropdown to `index.html` that triggers a Google Apps Script function in `Code.gs` upon user selection. The task will be decomposed into two sequential sub-tasks: one for frontend (HTML/JavaScript) modifications and another for backend (Google Apps Script) implementation.

## Sub-tasks List

1.  **Sub-task ID:** ROO#SUB_ROO#TASK_20250626193410_a1b2c3-DEV_S001_20250626193444_a1b2c3
    *   **Objective:** Implement the HTML dropdown menu in `index.html` and add client-side JavaScript to capture the selected value and call a Google Apps Script function.
    *   **Assigned Expert:** `rooroo-developer`

2.  **Sub-task ID:** ROO#SUB_ROO#TASK_20250626193410_a1b2c3-DEV_S002_20250626193444_d4e5f6
    *   **Objective:** Implement the server-side Google Apps Script function in `Code.gs` to receive and process the selected value from the HTML dropdown. Also, ensure the `onOpen` function creates the necessary menu item.

## Key Dependencies
*   Sub-task 2 depends on Sub-task 1, as the Apps Script function needs to be callable from the HTML.

## Assumptions Made
*   The `index.html` file is served within a Google Apps Script environment, allowing `google.script.run` to function correctly.
*   The user intends for a simple dropdown that passes a string value to the Apps Script.
