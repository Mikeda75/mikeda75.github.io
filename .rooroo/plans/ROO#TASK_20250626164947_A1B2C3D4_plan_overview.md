# Plan Overview for Google Sheet Access and Parsing

**Overall Strategy:**
The goal is to enable the program to directly access a Google Sheet via a web link and parse its data. This will involve a two-step process: first, researching the best method for accessing Google Sheet data from a web application, and then implementing that chosen method.

**Sub-tasks List:**

1.  **Research Google Sheet Access & Parsing (ROO#SUB_ROO#TASK_20250626164947_A1B2C3D4-S001_20250626164951_F1A2B3C4)**
    *   **Objective:** Identify the optimal method for directly accessing and parsing Google Sheet data via a web link within a web application context, considering options like CSV export and public Google Sheets API access. Provide a recommendation for the implementation approach.
    *   **Assigned Expert:** Rooroo Analyzer

**Key Dependencies:**
The implementation sub-task will depend on the outcome and recommendation from the research sub-task.

**Assumptions Made:**
*   The Google Sheet will be publicly accessible or accessible via a simple authentication method suitable for a web application.
*   The primary application file for integration is `paneloptimizerfinal.html`.

**Potential Risks:**
*   Google Sheet access limitations or API quotas.
*   Complexity of parsing various data formats from Google Sheets.
