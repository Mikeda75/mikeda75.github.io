# Plan Overview: Update Casting Layout Feature

## Overall Strategy:
The task involves enhancing the `paneloptimizerfinal.html` file to allow users to select between two predefined casting areas (Preset A and Preset B) and automatically adjust form fitting based on the selection. This will require modifications to the HTML structure for the dropdown, and JavaScript logic to handle the selection and update the layout.

## Sub-tasks List:
*   **Sub-task 1: Implement Casting Layout Feature**
    *   **Objective:** Modify `paneloptimizerfinal.html` to add a dropdown for casting area selection, define the dimensions for Preset A and Preset B, and implement the JavaScript logic for automatic form fitting based on the selected area.

## Key Dependencies:
None, this is a self-contained feature enhancement.

## Assumptions Made:
The `paneloptimizerfinal.html` file contains the necessary structure and existing JavaScript to integrate this new feature. The "form fitting" logic will need to be adapted or extended to work with the new casting area dimensions.

## Potential Risks:
Potential conflicts with existing JavaScript logic for layout or form handling.
