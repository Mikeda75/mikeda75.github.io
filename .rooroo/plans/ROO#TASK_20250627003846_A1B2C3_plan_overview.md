# Plan Overview: CWE Production Dashboard Navigation Analysis and Design

## Overall Strategy
This plan aims to thoroughly analyze the `index.html` file of the CWE Production Dashboard to understand its various sections and their intended purpose. Following this analysis, a clear navigation narrative and program flow will be designed, culminating in the documentation of these findings in `NavigationDesign.md`. The process is broken down into three sequential sub-tasks, each handled by a specialized Rooroo expert.

## Sub-tasks List

1.  **Sub-task: HTML Analysis**
    *   **Objective:** Analyze the `index.html` file to identify all distinct pages or sections, understand their individual purposes, and infer the intended user flow based on the HTML structure and JavaScript logic.
    *   **Assigned Expert:** Rooroo Analyzer

2.  **Sub-task: Navigation Narrative Design**
    *   **Objective:** Based on the detailed analysis from the previous step, design a comprehensive and clear navigation narrative and program flow for the CWE Production Dashboard. This includes defining transitions between views and the overall user journey.
    *   **Assigned Expert:** Rooroo Architect

3.  **Sub-task: Document Navigation Design**
    *   **Objective:** Update the `NavigationDesign.md` file with the newly designed navigation narrative and program flow, ensuring clarity, completeness, and adherence to documentation standards. This may include adding a user flow diagram or textual descriptions.
    *   **Assigned Expert:** Rooroo Documenter

## Key Dependencies
*   Sub-task 2 depends on the completion and output of Sub-task 1.
*   Sub-task 3 depends on the completion and output of Sub-task 2.

## Assumptions Made
*   The `index.html` file contains all necessary UI elements and JavaScript logic to infer the application's navigation and purpose.
*   The existing `NavigationDesign.md` serves as a starting point for documentation and will be updated, not entirely replaced.

## Potential Risks
*   The `index.html` might be heavily reliant on external JavaScript files or server-side logic (Google Apps Script) that are not fully accessible for direct analysis, potentially leading to an incomplete understanding of the flow. However, the provided `Code.gs` and the script block in `index.html` should mitigate this.
