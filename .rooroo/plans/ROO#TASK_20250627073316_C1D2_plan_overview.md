# Plan Overview for ROO#TASK_20250627073316_C1D2

## Overall Strategy
The task is to add two new features to the "casting layout feature": "Form base offset" and "Panel spacing modification". Both features require UI input and modification of existing logic. This will be broken down into two sequential sub-tasks, each handled by a Rooroo Developer, focusing on one feature at a time.

## Sub-tasks List

### Sub-task 1: Implement Form Base Offset
*   **Objective:** Add an input field for "Form base offset" and integrate its value to adjust panel dimensions.
*   **Assigned Expert:** Rooroo Developer
*   **Task ID:** ROO#SUB_C1D2-OFFSET_S001_20250627073323_RNDHEX
*   **Context File:** [.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_C1D2-OFFSET_S001_20250627073323_RNDHEX/context.md](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_C1D2-OFFSET_S001_20250627073323_RNDHEX/context.md)

### Sub-task 2: Implement Panel Spacing Modification
*   **Objective:** Add an input field for "Panel spacing modification" and integrate its value to adjust spacing between panels.
*   **Assigned Expert:** Rooroo Developer
*   **Task ID:** ROO#SUB_C1D2-SPACING_S002_20250627073323_RNDHEX
*   **Context File:** [.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_C1D2-SPACING_S002_20250627073323_RNDHEX/context.md](.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_C1D2-SPACING_S002_20250627073323_RNDHEX/context.md)

## Key Dependencies
Sub-task 2 depends on the completion of Sub-task 1, as both involve modifications to the same core files (`index.html` and `Code.gs`).

## Assumptions Made
*   The `index.html` file contains the primary user interface for the casting layout feature.
*   The `Code.gs` file contains the backend logic (Google Apps Script) that processes the input and calculates the layout.
*   The existing code structure allows for the addition of new input fields and the modification of dimension/spacing calculations without major refactoring.

## Potential Risks
*   Unexpected interactions between the two new features if not implemented carefully.
*   Complexity in identifying the exact locations for code modifications in `index.html` and `Code.gs` without prior detailed knowledge of their contents.
