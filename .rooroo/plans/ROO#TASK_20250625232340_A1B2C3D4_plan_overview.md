# Plan Overview: 2D Top-Down View of Physical Casting Layouts

## Overall Strategy
The goal is to develop a web-based application that allows users to design and visualize physical casting layouts. This will involve creating an interactive 2D top-down view where forms (rectangles) can be placed, moved, and rotated on a larger casting panel. The application will also support saving/loading layouts and generating printable output. The implementation will be broken down into three main sub-tasks, each handled by a Rooroo Developer expert, focusing on core visualization, user interaction/data management, and printable output, respectively.

## Sub-tasks List

1.  **Sub-task ID:** ROO#SUB_ROO#TASK_20250625232340_A1B2C3D4-CORE_S001_20250625232348_ABCDEF
    *   **Objective:** Implement the interactive 2D top-down view of physical casting layouts, including setting up the drawing canvas, drawing the casting panel, and displaying forms as rectangles.
    *   **Assigned Expert:** Rooroo Developer (rooroo-developer)
    *   **Context File:** `.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_ROO#TASK_20250625232340_A1B2C3D4-CORE_S001_20250625232348_ABCDEF/context.md`

2.  **Sub-task ID:** ROO#SUB_ROO#TASK_20250625232340_A1B2C3D4-INTERACT_S002_20250625232359_ABCDEF
    *   **Objective:** Implement user interaction and data management features, such as defining dimensions, interactive placement/movement/rotation of forms, and saving/loading layout configurations.
    *   **Assigned Expert:** Rooroo Developer (rooroo-developer)
    *   **Context File:** `.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_ROO#TASK_20250625232340_A1B2C3D4-INTERACT_S002_20250625232359_ABCDEF/context.md`

3.  **Sub-task ID:** ROO#SUB_ROO#TASK_20250625232340_A1B2C3D4-PRINT_S003_20250625232404_ABCDEF
    *   **Objective:** Implement the printable output functionality for the casting layout, ensuring accurate scaling and a print-friendly version.
    *   **Assigned Expert:** Rooroo Developer (rooroo-developer)
    *   **Context File:** `.rooroo/tasks/ROO#SUB_ROO#TASK_20250625232340_A1B2C3D4-PRINT_S003_20250625232404_ABCDEF/context.md`

## Key Dependencies
The sub-tasks are largely sequential, with each building upon the previous one. Core visualization is foundational, followed by interaction, and finally print functionality.

## Assumptions Made
*   The `paneloptimizerfinal.html` file will serve as the base for integrating the new functionality.
*   The solution will primarily use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (client-side).
*   User interaction will be primarily mouse-based for drag-and-drop and rotation.
*   Saving/loading will initially target browser local storage.
